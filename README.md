# titan-topography-sar
Calculate the geoid of Saturn's moon Titan, defined in Iess et al. (2010) and subtract the geoid from topography data (Cassini SARTopo).
Iess et al. (2010) showed that Titan's gravity field is consistent with a hydrostatically relaxed body shaped by tidal and rotational effects, making it slightly oblate. Subtracting an oblate spheroid from the topography can obtain the geopotential surface.
